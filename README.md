# NTM ZIRNOX Simulator
A ZIRNOX simulator, using the mechanics that are used in the minecraft mod HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod. 

Every single bit of code handling the simulation and the sprites are from the minecraft mod's source code. (it's open source!!!).
Everything else is made by myself.

This is a reactor simulation of a NTM reactor. [Also check out RBMK simulator](https://voxelstice.github.io/ntm-rbmk-simulator/)
